            <h1 id="h02"> What We Offer Students</h1>
            <p id="hours1"> <br> <br> Koda Kafe is more than just a dining hall; 
                we're a hub for students to unwind, connect, and recharge in the heart of UH Sugarland.
                With cozy seating areas and a welcoming ambiance, we provide the perfect backdrop for studying, socializing, or simply taking a moment for yourself. 
                <br> <br> 
                Convenience is key for busy students, which is why we offer flexible hours that align with your schedule and a location that's just steps away from your next class.
                Plus, our commitment to affordability means you can enjoy our offerings without breaking the bank. 
                Whether you need a quick caffeine fix between classes or a hearty meal to power through a study session, Koda Kafe has you covered.
                <br> <br>
                In addition, we offer students from the main campus a way of utilizing their already-owned meal plans!
                Just swipe your card at the front and use a meal exchange for several food options. 
                We accept cougar cash as well.
                <br> <br>
                Join us at Koda Kafe and discover why we're more than just a café – we're a home away from home for the entire UH Sugarland student community.

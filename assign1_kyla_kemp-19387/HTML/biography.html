            Welcome to Koda Kafe, <br> <br>
            where passion for food and community converge to create a warm and inviting atmosphere. Koda Kafe was founded by Kyla Kemp, a devoted college student at the University of Houston. Named after her faithful companion, Koda, this haven reflects her unwavering dedication to creating a welcoming space for her peers.
            <br><br>
            Navigating the bustling halls of academia, Kemp discerned the necessity for a welcoming space where peers could unwind, connect, and recharge amidst their demanding schedules. Inspired by the scarcity of dining options on campus, she embarked on the journey to realize this vision.
            <br><br>
            Balancing coursework with entrepreneurial responsibilities proved both challenging and rewarding for Kyla. However, driven by her passion for creating meaningful experiences and fostering belonging, she wholeheartedly invested in every aspect of Koda Kafe.
            <br><br>
            Beyond her endeavors with Koda Kafe, Kyla is passionate about programming and web page design. She personally crafted the cafeteria's online presence, leveraging her skills to create an inviting and user-friendly website where visitors can explore the menu, learn about upcoming events, and connect with the Koda Kafe community.
            <br><br>
            Today, Koda Kafe stands as a testament to Kempâ€™s commitment to providing a place for the University of Houston Sugarland community. More than just a cafeteria, it's a place where students convene to savor delicious food, forge enduring connections, and cultivate cherished memories.
            <br><br>
            Grateful for the opportunity to share this journey, Kyla Kemp extends a heartfelt invitation to join the Koda Kafe family, where every visit promises a sense of belonging.
